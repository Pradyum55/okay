        <h5>1. Earn from&nbsp;
            <em>Youtube</em>&nbsp; channel

        <h5>2. Start a Blog and Monetize your Content</h5>
        <p>You can easily start a blog, write content and monetize it. In my opinion, blogging is the best way to earn money with zero investment. Building your website with WordPress is fairly easy, but if you are totally new you should try Blogger first.
            Blogger provides excellent features, is easy to learn so you can get started with writing your content without worrying about the blog design, web hosting, etc. If you have general knowledge about web technologies like domain, hosting, nameservers,
            etc. and you’re looking for more thrilling experience then you may create your own website using wordpress, or similar other platforms. If you really interested to earn money online, then start writing blogs.</p>
        <p>To earn from blogging you need to be patient and need to write content regularly. It takes several months for your articles to be indexed by search engines. That’s when your visitors start to discover your content and they visit your website.
            Once you have regular visitors you can apply for Google Adsense and display ads. You’ll be paid whenever someone clicks on ads on your website. Most popular blogging topics may be educational blogs, language learning blogs, traveling tips,
            writing style, health and fitness self improvement and lifestyle, communication skills, self defense, tech blogs, reviews and many more.</p>
        <h5>3. Earn by Sharing Posts on Facebook</h5>
        <p>You can earn money online from Facebook if you have a good number of followers. For this method, you can create Facebook page and post interesting posts related to humor, music, lifestyle, travel, etc. targeting your audiences. See which of your
            posts are most liked, commented on or shared by your followers. Keep posting the type of content that your audiences want and grow the number of your followers; keep them engaged on your page by encouraging them to share the post, replying
            their comments and replying to their messages. You should first target for 100, 000 engaged audience to consider monetizing your Facebook page.</p>
        <p>Once you have a good number of followers you can post links to your Youtube channel and videos, your websites and blogs, your products and much more. You can also earn money by advertising products and links for other people. Also You can&nbsp;
            reach out to local businesses, hotels, restaurants, travel agencies offering to advertise their business. You can charge a flat rate for a post, or offer them to pay for the number of post engagements (likes, comments and shares). Once you
            have enough followers you can sit back and relax while your followers start earning money for you from your Facebook page. You can also use this technique to earn from your Instagram followers. </p>
